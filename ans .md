## Technical Questions

### 1. Difference between Metafield and Metaobject
- **Metafield**: A metafield in Shopify allows you to store additional information (metadata) for products, collections, orders, etc., beyond the default fields. It's commonly used to add custom data points to a resource.
- **Metaobject**: A metaobject is a more complex, reusable data structure for more intricate customization, often used when multiple related metafields are needed under one logical entity.

### 2. Collection Tab
The Collection tab in Shopify allows you to organize products into groups (collections) to make browsing easier for customers. You can set up manual collections (adding products individually) or automated collections (using specific criteria).

### 3. Shopify Global Objects
Shopify global objects are Liquid objects accessible across Shopify themes. They contain data related to the store and its resources, such as products, collections, cart, customer, and settings.

### 4. How to Get the Quantity of Respective Variant on the Main Product Page
Use Shopify’s Liquid code to loop through the product’s variants and display the available quantity. This can be achieved by accessing `product.variants` and displaying each variant’s quantity.

### 5. Cart APIs
Shopify’s Cart API allows developers to manage items in the cart programmatically, including adding, updating, and removing items. This API is useful for enhancing the cart experience, enabling custom cart flows, and dynamically adjusting items based on specific conditions.

### 6. How to Call the Parent Class Constructors in Custom Web Components
In JavaScript custom elements, use `super()` inside the constructor of a derived class to call the parent class’s constructor. This ensures the component is initialized correctly and inherits properties/methods from the parent class.

### 7. Why Do We Use the "this" Keyword in Custom Web Components?
The `this` keyword refers to the current instance of the component, used to access properties and methods defined within the component class. It is essential for handling the component's unique state and behavior.

### 8. Where Can We Use JavaScript `map` and `filter` in Shopify?
JavaScript’s `map` and `filter` functions are often used within Shopify themes for manipulating arrays, such as modifying product arrays or filtering certain conditions before displaying data on the storefront.

### 9. Summary of Internship Learnings
- **Technically**: Gained experience in Shopify development, working with Liquid templating, Shopify APIs, and metafields. Enhanced skills in JavaScript, custom web components, and problem-solving within the Shopify ecosystem.
- **Generally**: Improved communication and problem-solving skills, learned effective time management, and adapted to working in a fast-paced environment.

### 10. Name 5 Global Objects Available in Shopify
- `product`
- `collection`
- `cart`
- `customer`
- `shop`

### 11. Country Limits in Shopify Admin Panel
Shopify's admin panel allows setting specific country and region restrictions to manage where the store operates, ships to, or restricts access.

### 12. Difference between Metafield and Metaobject
See question 1 above.

### 13. Useful Cases of Using an Alternate Template (Other than a Gift Card)
Alternate templates are useful for custom layouts, such as creating a special template for promotional products, blog pages with unique styling, or seasonal collections with dedicated themes.
